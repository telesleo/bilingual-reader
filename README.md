# Bilingual reader

Bilingual Reader is a web-based application designed to help users read and study texts in a foreign language with translations. The application offers an interface with side-by-side views of the original text and its translation. Additionally, it includes a text-to-speech (TTS) feature that allows you to listen to the text. You can also click on individual sentences to listen to the audio for specific sections.
